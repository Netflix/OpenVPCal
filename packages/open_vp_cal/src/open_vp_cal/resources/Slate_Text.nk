 message "1. Turn off any part of the LED wall that is not directly in front of the camera and is required for the calibration.\n\n2. Warm up the camera and LED panels: display a flat grey color on the LED panels for at least 20 minutes before capture.\n\n3. If the generated calibration sequence has only one frame per patch, playback at a frame rate equal to 1/10 of the camera FPS: if the camera records at 25 FPS, set the playback to 2.5FPS. If the exact number of patches are available, the playback speed should be set at the camera FPS. Disable any type of frame blending and playback loops, the sequence should stop at its last frame.\n\n4. Bypass any unnecessary color transforms other than the ones required to map the calibration patches to the LED wall (invEOTF), if the patches are linear and not already in a display referred space. The chromaticity of the patches should not be modified. Disable previous calibrations, except the inbuilt Image Processor calibration for the LED panels.\n\n5. Ensure that the whole system from Media Player to Image Processor to Camera is correnctly genlocked."

 message "1. Set the LED panel to the maximum brightness allowed by the Image processor (do not override the gain). If using ST2084 (PQ) as EOTF, make sure that these two squares are equally bright:\n\n\n\n2. Check the video data range (Legal/Full) throughout the pipeline. If a difference can be perceived between the four squares below, it is correctly set. Otherwise, check the video pipeline from the media player to the wall, and make sure that the video range is set consistently. Don't trust video metadata and auto-settings, override the settings manually. Just note that when using ST2084 (PQ) as EOTF, the differences between the black patches might be imperceivable. \n\n\n\n\n3. Set the camera perpendicular to the wall, at a distance where it would be - on average - when shooting: the center square must look like a square and the circle must look like a circle. Scale the content until the center target gray square covers 60/70% of the vertical camera field of view.\n\n4. Defocus to prevent moire. Defocus towards the camera (closer focus): imagine you are focusing on an actor that is sitting in front of the wall. Defocus to the point where the inner black border disappears. Too little will cause moire, too much might cause the analysis to error.\n\n5. Set the exposure so that the center square hits 18% of the camera's sensitivity. Use the camera's false color tool or a light meter to set the exposure until the whole square is set to 18%. Use the 17% and 19% small patches as a reference to further center your exposure. Try not to use shutter angle or camera FPS to adjust the exposure as this will introduce multiplexing. ND filters will most likely be required.\n\n6. Either set the cameras white balance to match the led walls native white point eg. 6500K or your desired camera white balance. Alternatively auto white-balance the camera towards the center target gray square. Once ready, check the exposure again, as changing the camera's white balance can shift the exposure of the image. SEE USER GUIDE FOR MORE INFO\n\n7. Check for clipping. Use the below white patch and ensure that it is not clipping your sensor's sensitivity using the camera's false color tool:\n\n\n\n8. Set the camera recording mode to RAW or to a mode with an official and documented transform pipeline to ACES.\n\n9. Start recording on the camera and play the image sequence until it ends.\n"
